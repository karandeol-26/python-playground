# python-playground
A collection of Python problem sets, practice exercises, and mini-projects exploring programming concepts and problem-solving.

This repository is my Python playground — a space where I practice programming through problem sets (including CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python) and build small projects to strengthen my skills. It includes solutions, experiments, and hands-on exercises that reflect my journey in mastering Python fundamentals and applying them to real-world problems.
